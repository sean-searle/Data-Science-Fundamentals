# Analysis of Biodiversity in National Parks

This project analyzes data on plant and animal species and the location and number of observations per species. This was a free-form Data Science project and I decided to answer the following questions with the data:

What is the distribution of conservation status for species?
Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?
Where are sheep species most frequently sighted? (because why not)

I used descriptive statistics and data visualizations to determine the following key metrics:

Distributions
counts
relationship between species
conservation status of species
observations of species in parks

In the case of relative conservation rates of species, I used chi-squared tests to infer statistical significance of the data trends that I observed.

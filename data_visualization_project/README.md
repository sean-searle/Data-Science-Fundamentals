# Data Visualization Project

In this project, I analyze and visualize WHO data on National Life Expectancy and GDP. I use Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, and NumPy Python Libraries to build a Data Analysis Report. I then took the figures and findings and published [a Medium article](https://medium.com/@s.p.searle/an-analysis-of-life-expectancy-and-gdp-data-e1872cb15b1b).

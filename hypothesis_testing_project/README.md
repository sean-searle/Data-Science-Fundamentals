# Hypothesis Testing: Heart Disease Variables

The purpose of this project is to take heart disease research data (from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repo) and answer a collection of questions by running hypothesis tests for the association between two variables. Some questions that are answered are:

* Do people with heart disease have high cholesterol levels on average?
* Is the proportion of patients in the data with high fasting blood sugar larger than the national average?
* Is there a significant difference in cholesterol levels between heart disease/no heart disease patients?
* Do patients with different chest pain types have signifcantly different thalach (defined below)?
* Is the presence of heart disease significantly associated with chest pain type?

To answer these questions, I use the 1-sample t-test, binomial test, 2-sample t-test, ANOVA test, Tukey range test, and chi-squared test.

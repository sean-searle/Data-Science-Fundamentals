# Building Multiple Variable Linear Regression Models 

In this project, I build linear regression models and train them on [ATP data](https://datahub.io/sports-data/atp-world-tour-tennis-data) to predict tournament outcomes for tennis players based on their playing habits and statistics.

The main purpose of this project is to practice building simple and multiple linear regression models and calculate/visualize their accuracy.
